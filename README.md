Self Tests and Review Quiz questions from Connect:

We will probably have to do some work with these questions:
1) Add pictures - this might cause some questions to look weird, so have to readjust those questions
2) Coding standards - downloading files from Webwork messed up spacing, so that has to be standardized
3) Naming - names of files should be changed after we finalize naming 
4) Taxonomy - will have to be added to every problem
