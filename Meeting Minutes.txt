Overview of plan:

1) Existing Connect problems -> Webwork problems 
2) Make new problems -> graduate students - each take 3 engineering science courses for total of 6

Taxonomy: how to organize problems 

Create sandbox Webwork course 
Google sheets to keep track of problem - code, images, testing, student feedback

Fluid problems need to be redone - content and images  

Code for each problem to help keep track of progress 

Keywords system: course number, self test, overarching MECH 2, concepts 

Name problems: UBCMECH2Fluids1, UBCMECH2Fluids2

New 160 and convert current questions (600)

Large integrated problems - midterms, finals?
