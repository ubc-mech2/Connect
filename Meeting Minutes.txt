Overview of plan:

1) Existing Connect problems -> Webwork problems 
2) Make new problems -> graduate students - each take 3 engineering science courses for total of 6

Taxonomy: how to organize problems 

Create sandbox Webwork course 
Google sheets to keep track of problem - code, images, testing, student feedback

Fluid problems need to be redone - content and images  

Code for each problem to help keep track of progress 

Keywords system: course number, self test, overarching MECH 2, concepts 

Name problems: UBCMECH2Fluids1, UBCMECH2Fluids2

New 160 and convert current questions (600)

Large integrated problems - midterms, finals?

June 23, 2017:

All problem sets ported over from Connect

Searchability: taxonomy and keywords in the header of problems
3 tags put on each problem: subject, chapter, section - analogous to textbook

Possibly Benny's job to go through textbook and determine keywords 

1 or 2 common keywords in each problem 

Investigate: webwork open library keyword search - how effective?

Write problems first, solutions later if time permits 

Put old problems into GitHub repo

Fluids problems have to be rewritten - previously developed Fluids problems can be fixed up 

Jenny's problems likely do not have to be redone - only images

Circuit image building - ask Linares 

Pulling problems to OPL to test - ask Sophie to prioritize graphics
Fit into existing taxonomy and upload 
Find a self test with very few images, make images, pull to OPL 

Get in touch with person in charge of UBC GitHub webwork pulling 

Taxonomy: subject, chapter, section, keywords, author, institution, language
Email address? webwork@apsc.ubc.ca? 

Try to get testing going ASAP

Math - use already existing taxonomy
