BEGIN_TEXT
Consider a similar parabolic force distribution as from Problem 9 but in this case the constant \(w_0\) is unknown. What is known is that the supporting reaction force at the triangular pivot point is \(300N\). At what value of \(x_0\) should the \(200 N\) force be positioned in order to keep the beam in balance?
