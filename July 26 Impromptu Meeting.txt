Subject, Chapter, Section do not make sense for other institutions

Subject cannot be course name - depend on content

Keywords: MECH 220, Practice Quizzes 

Dropbox, Google Drive to store new problems from TAs

Plan:

Taxonomy for: calculus, linear algebra, circuits - match to subjects, chapters, and sections in OPL
Use keywords: MECH 220, self test, subject area (eg. derivatives)

Upload problem sets and 220 review quizzes to OPL, but not prelabs 
Keep 220 review quiz together in one folder 

Use taxonomy in MECH 2 proposal: put course, type, original set, and current set into keywords too,
okay to have large number of keywords 

Use Agnes as contact - spell name correct
